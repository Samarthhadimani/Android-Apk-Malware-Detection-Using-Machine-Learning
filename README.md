Android-Apk-Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

We considered static, dynamic, and hybrid detection analysis. In this performance analysis,we compared static,dynamic,and hybrid analyses on the basis of data set, feature extraction techniques, feature selection techniques, detection methods, and the accuracy achieved by these methods. Therefore,we identify suspicious API calls, system calls, and the permissions that are extracted and selected as features to detect mobile malware.

Feature Extraction:
1.For Static Feature Extraction we used a tool called Jadx.
2.To install Jadx follow the steps below:-
      ->git clone https://github.com/skylot/jadx.git
      ->cd jadx
      ->./gradlew dist
  Install it in your Project Folder and Run ExtractorAIO.py it extracts the Static Features and stores in a .csv File

3.For Dynamic Features Extraction wee used AndroPyTool So to Extract Dynamic Features please refer https://github.com/alexMyG/AndroPyTool
4.There is Three Folders SVM,KNN,DECISION TREE and in each folders there are 3 models like Static,Dynamic,Hybrid So you can run those three files and compare the results.
