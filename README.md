Android-Apk-Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

We considered static, dynamic, and hybrid detection analysis. In this performance analysis,we compared static,dynamic,and hybrid analyses on the basis of data set, feature extraction techniques, feature selection techniques, detection methods, and the accuracy achieved by these methods. Therefore,we identify suspicious API calls, system calls, and the permissions that are extracted and selected as features to detect mobile malware.

Feature Extraction:
1.For Static Feature Extraction we used a tool called Jadx\n.
2.To install Jadx follow the steps below:-
